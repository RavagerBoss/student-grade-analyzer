# Student Grade Analyzer 

This Python script reads student data from a CSV file, calculates total and average marks, assigns pass/fail status, and exports the results into a new `report.csv`.

##  How It Works
- Input: `marks.csv` (with name and 5 subject marks)
- Output: `report.csv` (with total, average, result)


##  Sample Input
```csv
Name,Math,Physics,Chemistry,Biology,English
Aakash,78,85,66,74,80
Priya,55,40,88,92,89

## Sample Output

```csv
Name,Total,Average,Result
Aakash,383.0,76.6,PASS
Priya,364.0,72.8,PASS
